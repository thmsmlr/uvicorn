Introduction Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server, built on uvloop and httptools . Until recently Python has lacked a minimal low-level server/application interface for asyncio frameworks. The ASGI specification fills this gap, and means we're now able to start building a common set of tooling usable across all asyncio frameworks. ASGI should help enable an ecosystem of Python web frameworks that are highly competitive against Node and Go in terms of achieving high throughput in IO-bound contexts. It also provides support for HTTP/2 and WebSockets, which cannot be handled by WSGI. Uvicorn currently supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSockets. Support for HTTP/2 is planned. Quickstart Requirements: Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 Install using pip : $ pip install uvicorn Create an application, in app.py : class App (): def __init__ ( self , scope ): assert scope [ 'type' ] == 'http' self . scope = scope async def __call__ ( self , receive , send ): await send ({ 'type' : 'http.response.start' , 'status' : 200 , 'headers' : [ [ b 'content-type' , b 'text/plain' ], ] }) await send ({ 'type' : 'http.response.body' , 'body' : b 'Hello, world!' , }) Run the server: $ uvicorn app:App Usage The uvicorn command line tool is the easiest way to run your application...

For more information, see the settings documentation . Running programmatically To run uvicorn directly from your application... import uvicorn class App : ... if __name__ == \"__main__\" : uvicorn . run ( App , \"127.0.0.1\" , 5000 , log_level = \"info\" ) Running with Gunicorn Gunicorn is a mature, fully featured server and process manager. Uvicorn includes a Gunicorn worker class allowing you to run ASGI applications, with all of Uvicorn's performance benefits, while also giving you Gunicorn's fully-featured process management. This allows you to increase or decrease the number of worker processes on the fly, restart worker processes gracefully, or perform server upgrades without downtime. For production deployments we recommend using gunicorn with the uvicorn worker class. gunicorn app:App -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker For a PyPy compatible configuration use uvicorn.workers.UvicornH11Worker . For more information, see the deployment documentation . The ASGI interface Uvicorn uses the ASGI specification for interacting with an application. The application should expose a callable which takes one argument, scope . This callable is used to create a new instance of the application for each incoming connection. It must return a coroutine which the server can then call into. The application instance coroutine takes two arguments, (receive, send) , which are the channels by which messages are sent between the web server and client application. One style of implementation is to use a class with an __init__() method to handle application instantiation, and a __call__() coroutine to provide the application implementation. class App (): def __init__ ( self , scope ): self . scope = scope async def __call__ ( self , receive , send ): ... The content of the scope argument, and the messages expected by receive and send depend on the protocol being used. The format for HTTP messages is described in the ASGI HTTP Message format . HTTP Scope An incoming HTTP request might instantiate an application with the following scope : { 'type' : 'http.request' , 'scheme' : 'http' , 'root_path' : '' , 'server' : ( '127.0.0.1' , 8000 ), 'http_version' : '1.1' , 'method' : 'GET' , 'path' : '/' , 'headers' : [ [ b 'host' , b '127.0.0.1:8000' ], [ b 'user-agent' , b 'curl/7.51.0' ], [ b 'accept' , b '*/*' ] ] } HTTP Messages The instance coroutine communicates back to the server by sending messages to the send coroutine. await send ({ 'type' : 'http.request.start' , 'status' : 200 , 'headers' : [ [ b 'content-type' , b 'text/plain' ], ] }) await send ({ 'type' : 'http.request.body' , 'body' : b 'Hello, world!' , }) Requests & responses Here's an example that displays the method and path used in the incoming request: class EchoMethodAndPath (): def __init__ ( self , scope ): self . scope = scope async def __call__ ( self , receive , send ): body = 'Received %s request to %s ' % ( self . scope [ 'method' ], self . scope [ 'path' ]) await send ({ 'type' : 'http.response.start' , 'status' : 200 , 'headers' : [ [ b 'content-type' , b 'text/plain' ], ] }) await send ({ 'type' : 'http.response.body' , 'body' : body . encode ( 'utf-8' ), }) Reading the request body You can stream the request body without blocking the asyncio task pool, by fetching messages from the receive coroutine. class EchoBody (): def __init__ ( self , scope ): self . scope = scope async def read_body ( self , receive ): \"\"\" Read and return the entire body from an incoming ASGI message. \"\"\" body = b '' more_body = True while more_body : message = await receive () body += message . get ( 'body' , b '' ) more_body = message . get ( 'more_body' , False ) return body async def __call__ ( self , receive , send ): body = await self . read_body ( receive ) await send ({ 'type' : 'http.response.start' , 'status' : 200 , 'headers' : [ [ b 'content-type' , b 'text/plain' ], ] }) await send ({ 'type' : 'http.response.body' , 'body' : body , }) Streaming responses You can stream responses by sending multiple http.response.body messages to the send coroutine. class StreamResponse (): def __init__ ( self , scope ): self . scope = scope async def __call__ ( self , receive , send ): body = await self . read_body ( receive ) await send ({ 'type' : 'http.response.start' , 'status' : 200 , 'headers' : [ [ b 'content-type' , b 'text/plain' ], ] }) for chunk in [ b 'Hello' , b ', ' , b 'world!' ] await send ({ 'type' : 'http.response.body' , 'body' : chunk , 'more_body' : True }) await send ({ 'type' : 'http.response.body' , 'body' : b '' , }) Alternative ASGI servers Daphne The first ASGI server implementation, originally developed to power Django Channels, is the Daphne webserver . It is run widely in production, and supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and WebSockets. Any of the example applications given here can equally well be run using daphne instead. $ pip install daphne $ daphne app:App Hypercorn Hypercorn was initially part of the Quart web framework, before being separated out into a standalone ASGI server. Hypercorn supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and WebSockets. $ pip install hypercorn $ hypercorn app:App ASGI frameworks You can use Uvicorn, Daphne, or Hypercorn to run any ASGI framework. For small services you can also write ASGI applications directly. Starlette Starlette is a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit. It is ideal for building high performance asyncio services, and supports both HTTP and WebSockets. Django Channels The ASGI specification was originally designed for use with Django Channels . Channels is a little different to other ASGI frameworks in that it provides an asynchronous frontend onto a threaded-framework backend. It allows Django to support WebSockets, background tasks, and long-running connections, with application code still running in a standard threaded context. Quart Quart is a Flask-like ASGI web framework. FastAPI FastAPI is an API framework based on Starlette and Pydantic , heavily inspired by previous server versions of APIStar . You write your API function parameters with Python 3.6+ type declarations and get automatic data conversion, data validation, OpenAPI schemas (with JSON Schemas) and interactive API documentation UIs.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server, built on uvloop and httptools .

See the settings documentation for more details on the supported options for running uvicorn. Running programmatically To run directly from within a Python program, you should use uvicorn.run(app, **config) . For example: import uvicorn class App : ... if __name__ == \"__main__\" : uvicorn . run ( App , host = \"127.0.0.1\" , port = 5000 , log_level = \"info\" , reload = True ) The set of configuration options is the same as for the command line tool. Using a process manager Running Uvicorn using a process manager ensures that you can run multiple processes in a resilient manner, and allows you to perform server upgrades without dropping requests. A process manager will handle the socket setup, start-up multiple server processes, monitor process aliveness, and listen for signals to provide for processes restarts, shutdowns, or dialing up and down the number of running processes. Uvicorn provides a lightweight way to run multiple worker processes, for example --workers 4 , but does not provide any process monitoring. Gunicorn Gunicorn is probably the simplest way to run and manage Uvicorn in a production setting. Uvicorn includes a gunicorn worker class that means you can get set up with very little configuration. The following will start Gunicorn with four worker processes: gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker The UvicornWorker implementation uses the uvloop and httptools implementations. To run under PyPy you'll want to use pure-python implementation instead. You can do this by using the UvicornH11Worker class. gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornH11Worker Gunicorn provides a different set of configuration options to Uvicorn, so some options such as --limit-concurrency are not yet supported when running with Gunicorn. Supervisor To use supervisor as a process manager you should either: Hand over the socket to uvicorn using its file descriptor, which supervisor always makes available as 0 , and which must be set in the fcgi-program section. Or use a UNIX domain socket for each uvicorn process. A simple supervisor configuration might look something like this: supervisord.conf : [supervisord] [fcgi-program:uvicorn] socket = tcp://localhost:8000 command = venv/bin/uvicorn --fd 0 example:App numprocs = 4 process_name = uvicorn-%(process_num)d stdout_logfile = /dev/stdout stdout_logfile_maxbytes = 0 Then run with supervisord -n . Circus To use circus as a process manager, you should either: Hand over the socket to uvicorn using its file descriptor, which circus makes available as $(circus.sockets.web) . Or use a UNIX domain socket for each uvicorn process. A simple circus configuration might look something like this: circus.ini : [watcher:web] cmd = venv/bin/uvicorn --fd $(circus.sockets.web) example:App use_sockets = True numprocesses = 4 [socket:web] host = 0.0.0.0 port = 8000 Then run circusd circus.ini . Running behind Nginx Using Nginx as a proxy in front of your Uvicorn processes may not be neccessary, but is recommended for additional resiliance. Nginx can deal with serving your static media and buffering slow requests, leaving your application servers free from load as much as possible. In managed environments such as Heroku , you wont typically need to configure Nginx, as your server processes will already be running behind load balancing proxies. The recommended configuration for proxying from Nginx is to use a UNIX domain socket between Nginx and whatever the process manager that is being used to run Uvicorn. When fronting the application with a proxy server you want to make sure that the proxy sets headers to ensure that application can properly determine the client address of the incoming connection, and if the connection was over http or https . You should ensure that the X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto headers are set by the proxy, and that Uvicorn is run using the --proxy-headers setting. This ensure that the ASGI scope includes correct client and scheme information. Here's how a simple Nginx configuration might look. This example includes setting proxy headers, and using a UNIX domain socket to communicate with the application server. http { server { listen 80; client_max_body_size 4G; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_set_header Host $http_host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_redirect off; proxy_buffering off; proxy_pass http://uvicorn; } location /static { # path for static files root /path/to/app/static; } } upstream uvicorn { server unix:/tmp/uvicorn.sock; } } Uvicorn's --proxy-headers behavior may not be sufficient for more complex proxy configurations that use different combinations of headers, or where the application is running behind more than one intermediary proxying service. In those cases you might want to use an ASGI middleware to set the client and scheme dependant on the request headers. Running behind a CDN Running behind a content delivery network, such as Cloudflare or Cloud Front, provides a serious layer of protection against DDOS attacks. Your sevice will be running behind huge clusters of proxies and load balancers that are designed for handling huge amounts of traffic, and have capabilities for detecting and closing off connections from DDOS attacks. Proper usage of cache control headers can mean that a CDN is able to serve large amounts of data without always having to forward the request on to your server. Content Delivery Networks can also be a low-effort way to provide HTTPS termination. Running with HTTPS To run uvicorn with https, a certificate and a private key are required. The recommended way to get them is using Let's Encrypt . For local development with https, it's possible to use mkcert to generate a valid certificat and private key. $ uvicorn app:App --port 5000 --ssl-keyfile = ./key.pem --ssl-certfile = ./cert.pem Running gunicorn worker It also possible to use certificates with uvicorn's worker for gunicorn $ gunicorn --keyfile = ./key.pem --certfile = ./cert.pem -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app:App","title":"Deployment"},{"location":"deployment/#deployment","text":"Server deployment is a complex area, that will depend on what kind of service you're deploying Uvicorn onto.

Nginx can deal with serving your static media and buffering slow requests, leaving your application servers free from load as much as possible. In managed environments such as Heroku , you wont typically need to configure Nginx, as your server processes will already be running behind load balancing proxies. The recommended configuration for proxying from Nginx is to use a UNIX domain socket between Nginx and whatever the process manager that is being used to run Uvicorn. When fronting the application with a proxy server you want to make sure that the proxy sets headers to ensure that application can properly determine the client address of the incoming connection, and if the connection was over http or https . You should ensure that the X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto headers are set by the proxy, and that Uvicorn is run using the --proxy-headers setting. This ensure that the ASGI scope includes correct client and scheme information. Here's how a simple Nginx configuration might look. This example includes setting proxy headers, and using a UNIX domain socket to communicate with the application server. http { server { listen 80; client_max_body_size 4G; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_set_header Host $http_host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_redirect off; proxy_buffering off; proxy_pass http://uvicorn; } location /static { # path for static files root /path/to/app/static; } } upstream uvicorn { server unix:/tmp/uvicorn.sock; } } Uvicorn's --proxy-headers behavior may not be sufficient for more complex proxy configurations that use different combinations of headers, or where the application is running behind more than one intermediary proxying service. In those cases you might want to use an ASGI middleware to set the client and scheme dependant on the request headers.","title":"Running behind Nginx"},{"location":"deployment/#running-behind-a-cdn","text":"Running behind a content delivery network, such as Cloudflare or Cloud Front, provides a serious layer of protection against DDOS attacks.

It aims to ensure graceful behavior to either server or client errors, and resilience to poor client behavior or denial of service attacks. HTTP Headers The Server and Date headers are added to all outgoing requests. If a Connection: Close header is included then Uvicorn will close the connection after the response. Otherwise connections will stay open, pending the keep-alive timeout. If a Content-Length header is included then Uvicorn will ensure that the content length of the response body matches the value in the header, and raise an error otherwise. If no Content-Length header is included then Uvicorn will use chunked encoding for the response body, and will set a Transfer-Encoding header if required. If a Transfer-Encoding header is included then any Content-Length header will be ignored. HTTP headers are mandated to be case-insensitive. Uvicorn will always send response headers strictly in lowercase. Flow Control Proper flow control ensures that large amounts of data does not become buffered on the transport when either side of a connection is sending data faster than its counterpart is able to handle. Write flow control If the write buffer passes a high water mark, then Uvicorn ensures the ASGI send messages will only return once the write buffer has been drained below the low water mark. Read flow control Uvicorn will pause reading from a transport once the buffered request body hits a high water mark, and will only resume once receive has been called, or once the response has been sent. Request and Response bodies Response completion Once a response has been sent, Uvicorn will no longer buffer any remaining request body. Any later calls to recieve will return an http.disconnect message. Together with the read flow control, this behavior ensures that responses that return without reading the request body will not stream any substantial amounts of data into memory. Expect: 100-Continue The Expect: 100-Continue header may be sent by clients to require a confirmation from the server before uploading the request body. This can be used to ensure that large request bodies are only sent once the client has confirmation that the server is willing to accept the request. Uvicorn ensures that any required 100 Continue confirmations are only sent if the ASGI application calls receive to read the request body. Note that that proxy configurations may not necessarily forward on Expect: 100-Continue headers. In particular Nginx defaults to buffering request bodies, and automatically sends 100 Continues rather than passing the header on to the upstream server. HEAD requests Uvicorn will strip any response body from HTTP requests with the HEAD method. Applications should generally treat HEAD requests in the same manner as GET requests, in order to ensure that identical headers are sent in both cases, and that any ASGI middleware that modifies the headers will operate identically in either case. One exception to this might be if your application serves large file downloads, in which case you might wish to only generate the response headers. Timeouts Uvicorn provides the following timeouts: Keep-Alive. Defaults to 5 seconds. Between requests, connections must receive new data within this period or be disconnected. Resource Limits Uvicorn provides the following resource limiting: Concurrency. Defaults to None . If set, this provides a maximum number of concurrent tasks or open connections that should be allowed. Any new requests or connections that occur once this limit has been reached will result in a \"503 Service Unavailable\" response. Setting this value to a limit that you know your servers are able to support will help ensure reliable resource usage, even against significantly over-resourced servers. Max requests. Defaults to None . If set, this provides a maximum number of HTTP requests that will be serviced before terminating a process. Together with a process manager this can be used to prevent memory leaks from impacting long running processes. Server Errors Server errors will be logged at the error log level. All logging defaults to being written to stdout . Exceptions If an exception is raised by an ASGI application, and a response has not yet been sent on the connection, then a 500 Server Error HTTP response will be sent. Invalid responses Uvicorn will ensure that ASGI applications send the correct sequence of messages, and will raise errors otherwise. This includes checking for no response sent, partial response sent, or invalid message sequences being sent. Graceful Process Shutdown Graceful process shutdowns are particularly important during a restart period. During this period you want to: Start a number of new server processes to handle incoming requests, listening on the existing socket. Stop the previous server processes from listening on the existing socket. Close any connections that are not currently waiting on an HTTP response, and wait for any other connections to finalize their HTTP responses. Wait for any background tasks to run to completion, such as occurs when the ASGI application has sent the HTTP response, but the asyncio task has not yet run to completion. Uvicorn handles process shutdown gracefully, ensuring that connections are properly finalized, and all tasks have run to completion. During a shutdown period Uvicorn will ensure that responses and tasks must still complete within the configured timeout periods. HTTP Pipelining HTTP/1.1 provides support for sending multiple requests on a single connection, before having received each corresponding response. Servers are required to support HTTP pipelining, but it is now generally accepted to lead to implementation issues. It is not enabled on browsers, and may not necessarily be enabled on any proxies that the HTTP request passes through. Uvicorn supports pipelining pragmatically. It will queue up any pipelined HTTP requests, and pause reading from the underlying transport. It will not start processing pipelined requests until each response has been dealt with in turn.","title":"Server Behavior"},{"location":"server-behavior/#server-behavior","text":"Uvicorn is designed with particular attention to connection and resource management, in order to provide a robust server implementation.
